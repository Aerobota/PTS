## Latest News (28.04.2017)

Links fixed with new landmark. See blog for more details.

## Published Tile Sets
### GTOPO 30
Initial dataset is derived from GTOPO30 sources. It has 1km resolution approx. for the whole world and i believe this tileset is identical with the Cesium one. They have added more data onto it so might be slight differences.

This dataset is detailed up to LEVEL 9  and consists of nearly 700K tile files. I have added this whole tileset available for download.
